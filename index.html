			<cmd-line-text>Hello World! I am Matthew Roberson. A passionate Software Engineer in training.</cmd-line-text>
			<div class="content-grid-div">
				<flip-card header="About Me" img="about_img">
					I am a tech enthusiast and programming nerd from Northeast Oklahoma. 
					I developed a passion for computer science in middle school, and have 
					been programming ever since. I am largely self taught, and relied on 
					the online coding community to grow my skills.
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Interests" img="baseball_img">
					Beyond coding, my other main interest is sports. I grew up playing 
					baseball and basketball. I can watch any sporting event that is on 
					TV, but my favorite teams include the New York Yankees, the Oklahoma City 
					Thunder, and my future alma mater, Oklahoma State University. (Go Pokes!)
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Favorite Language" img="heart_img">
					My favorite language to code in is Kotlin. It feels like an elegant 
					successor to Java for Android Applications. I particularly appreciate 
					the advantage that scope functions provide in writing concise but powerful code.
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Contact Me" img="mail_img">
					Want to get in contact? <br> Please do not hesitate to reach out! <br><br> I 
					can be reached most easily at my email address: <br><br> <u>mattjroberson@gmail.com</u>

		<info-section id="Education" color="#ff9900">
			<cmd-line-text>I am a Junior Computer Science student at Oklahoma State University. GPA: 3.8</cmd-line-text>
			<div class="content-grid-div">
				<flip-card header="Data Structures" img="datastructs_img">
					Data Structures and Algorithms taught me the fundamentals of writing 
					efficient code. I learned the basic applications of Big O notation, and studied 
					the most common searching and sorting algorithms. Throughout the course, I 
					wrote from scratch many of the data structures found in Java.Util.
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Software Engineering" img="agile_img">
					Software Engineering provided me with an appreciation for different software 
					development lifecycles, with an emphasis on the Agile process. In a hands-on 
					course, I was exposed to common paradigms such as SCRUM and Extreme Programming.
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Robotics" img="ros_img">
					In an Honors Class add-on for Computer Science II, I had the privilege of 
					learning the methods of programming robots using the Robot Operating System. I
					learned the basics of input controllers, spatial awareness, object recognition, 
					and PID control systems.
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Mobile App Dev" img="android_img">
					This course taught me the process of developing Android and IOS applications, and 
					how the approach differs from other mediums. I wrote code in both Swift and Kotlin, 
					and produced a fully functional final application. (See Projects page)
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Cloud Computing" img="cloud_img">
					In the Spring of 2022 I will get the opportunity to learn about modern cloud 
					computing applications and techniques. This is an area of software engineering 
					that has piqued my interest recently.

		<info-section id="Skills" color="#00ccff">
			<cmd-line-text>I love the opportunity to learn new tools and skills.</cmd-line-text>
			<div class="content-grid-div">
				<flip-card header="C#" img="cSharp_img">
					C# Is one of the languages I feel most comfortable in. I have done a large 
					amount of programming in C# for different Unity projects. (See Projects page)
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Android Studio" img="androidStudios_img">
					I have extended experience creating and deploying apps in the Android Studio 
					IDE. As mentioned on my home page, Kotlin is my favorite language to code in. 
					(See Project page for two examples)
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Java" img="java_img">
					Java is the language I have coded in the most. Most of the code I wrote 
					early on was in Java, and it is also the language taught in Computer Science 
					I and II at my university.
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="JavaScript & HTML5" img="jScript_img">
					JavaScript is a new addition to my skillset. I learned to code in JS and HTML5 to 
					expand my horizons into front-end development, which is a relatively new space to me.
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Git VCS" img="github_img" link="https://github.com/mattjroberson">
					Proper use of Git version control has been a valuable skill that has improved my efficiency
					in personal projects. I am comfortable with both the git workflow and the Github interface.

				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Python" img="python_img">
					Python was one of the first languages I learned. It was the main language used in the 
					Robotics university course described on the Education page. I am comfortable writing Python 
					code, although it is not one of my preferred languages.
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Unity" img="unity_img">
					As mentioned in the C# card, I have done several projects in the Unity Game
					Engine, and am comfortable working on projects in that environment. 
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="C++" img="cpp_img">
					While I have not done many personal projects using C++, I have taken a university 
					course on the language, and am accustomed to its syntax. I would consider myself 
					familiar but not fluent in the language.
