		<info-section id="Education" color="#ff9900">
			<cmd-line-text>I received my Bachelors of Computer Science from Oklahoma State University. Below are several impactful courses from my degree.</cmd-line-text>
			<div class="content-grid-div">
				<flip-card header="Data Structures" img="datastructs_img">
					Data Structures and Algorithms taught me the fundamentals of writing 
					efficient code. I learned the basic applications of Big O notation, and studied 
					the most common searching and sorting algorithms.
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Software Engineering" img="agile_img">
					Software Engineering provided me with an appreciation for different software 
					development lifecycles, with an emphasis on the Agile process. In a hands-on 
					course, I was exposed to common paradigms such as Scrum and Extreme Programming.
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Robotics" img="ros_img">
					In an Honors Class add-on for Computer Science II, I had the chance to 
					learn the methods of programming robots using the Robot Operating System. I
					learned the basics of input controllers, spatial awareness, object recognition, 
					and PID control systems.
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Mobile App Dev" img="android_img">
					This course taught me the process of developing Android and IOS applications, and 
					how the approach differs from other mediums. I wrote code in both Swift and Kotlin, 
					and produced a fully functional final application. (See Projects page)
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Cloud Computing" img="cloud_img">
					We explored the principle concepts of distributed computing, including introductions
					to the Apache Hadoop and Spark technologies. Investigated the algorithms behind large
					document search and term frequency index backed search algorithms.

				<flip-card header="Android Studio" img="androidStudios_img">
					I have extended experience creating and deploying apps in the Android Studio 
					IDE. As mentioned on my home page, Kotlin is my favorite language to code in. 
					(See Project page for two examples)
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="Java" img="java_img">
					Java is the language I have coded in the most. Most of the code I wrote 
					early on was in Java, and it is also the language taught in Computer Science 
					I and II at my university.
				</flip-card>
				<flip-card header="JavaScript & HTML5" img="jScript_img">
					JavaScript is a new addition to my skillset. I learned to code in JS and HTML5 to
